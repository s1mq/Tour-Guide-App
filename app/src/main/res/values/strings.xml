    <string name="ungru_manor_desc">The ruins of the Ungru manor used to represent one of the most
        impressive Neo-Baroque buildings in Estonia, although it never was really finished. Its
        sophisticated footprint and the numerous baroque volute ornaments on its gables are
        characteristic for the castle.
        \nInteresting to know: The Ungru Manor was an almost exact copy of the Merseburg castle in
        Germany. After World War II the manor fell into the hands of Soviet troops, in 1968 the
        chief of the airport decided to use the ruins of the manor to fill in the holes in the
        runway. About one third of the manor was torn down, fortunately the rest was preserved
        until today. Compare the neat ruins of the manor to the contrasting Soviet airfield remains
